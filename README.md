# Speech-Compression

This project was done during a course at Georgiatech in 2019. In a group a two people, we modeled a piece of software to process a noisy speech singal. In the first place, we analysed the global record to find methods so that we could isolate the speech from the noise.Then, we selected an adequate lossy compression algorithm to compress the speech. Note that we could reconstructed the initial audio record from the compressed speec and the remaining noise. 

The signal processing was designed on matlab and the compression part is a set of C programs (G729 algorithm).
